# A Basic Survey Form

This project was completed as part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum. It features a form with 7 types of inputs/fields with HTML5 validation.

## Reflection

This project was my first foray into CSS Flexbox and HTML5 validation. Creating paralell columns with Flexbox proved to be the biggest challenge of the project, but I ended up with a greater appreciation for this useful tool.
